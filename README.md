# Odin Project tic-tac-toe.
A tic-tac-toe game that I developed during The Odin Project JavaScript course using Bootstrap5, SASS, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
This was particularly challenging as the main focus of this project was to adopt a particular style of programming. Such as the following:  
Using factory functions and modules.  
Ensuring that code remained private, not public, unless necessary to do so.  
Using closure, abstraction and encapsulation.  
IIFE were also used during this project.  

I definitely have a much greater understanding of the above concepts after this project as I was able to build an entire tic-tac-toe project essentially within one big function that is initiated on DOMContentLoad.
I added my own spin on this and created another module that contained some helper functions. (E.g. capitalize first letter of a string).

Admittedly, I found myself very stuck with some of the logic in this project and inevitably used other resources to point me in the right direction with some of that logic; this entailed taking some code from a YouTube video for example. However, as usual, I took time to breakdown any code that I did not understand and tried to remain focussed on the main point of this project. Overall, this has been very humbling and challenging for me, but I am relatively happy with the result.
